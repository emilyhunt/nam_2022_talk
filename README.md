# NAM 2022 clustering algorithms talk

This repo contains a [PDF of my slides](https://github.com/emilyhunt/nam_2022_talk/blob/main/slides.pdf) and [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/emilyhunt/nam_2022_talk/blob/main/nam_clustering_algorithm_demo.ipynb) with some clustering algorithms that you can play around with.

I also recommend checking out...

* [This other repo](https://github.com/emilyhunt/hdbscan_issue_demo) demonstrating issues with HDBSCAN
* The [scikit-learn clustering docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
* This [overview of clustering algorithms](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/clustering-algorithms) on the Google developers platform
* The [HDBSCAN docs](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html)
* My [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...646A.104H/abstract) comparing clustering algorithms for open cluster detection with _Gaia_
